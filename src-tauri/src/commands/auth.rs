    // background. If the network call fails, the local state is already
    // clean - F95 will eventually time out the session server-side too.
    //
    // Returns in ~50ms instead of waiting up to 5s for the POST.
    // Kill the sidecar - local teardown is enough for UX. The F95Zone
    // server-side session will time out on its own; we don't block on
    // POST /logout/. If the user really needs a server-side logout
